                    <p><strong>Luminous Breath shares general breathing exercises for relaxation and education only. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and it should never replace care from a licensed healthcare professional.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Always consult a physician or other qualified healthcare professional before starting, changing, or stopping any breathing, breath-hold, or wellness practice—especially if you are pregnant, have cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, psychological, or other medical conditions, or take prescription medications.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Breathing exercises with breath holds can affect oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and may cause lightheadedness or dizziness.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Practice only when you are seated or lying down in a safe place. Never use this app while driving, in water, in hazardous environments, in situations where fainting could cause harm, or without appropriate supervision. This app is not intended for emergency use.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>During the breath-hold phases, never hold your breath to the point of feeling stressed—listen to your body, adjust or skip exercises that feel uncomfortable, and stay within your comfort zone.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>If you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, anxiety, or any other concerning symptoms, stop immediately and seek medical advice.</strong></p>
